React Signature Input

This project provides a reusable signature input component in React, allowing users to draw their signature using a mouse or touch device, or type their name to generate a signature-like script. It's built using react-signature-canvas and Material-UI, and it's designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Features

    Signature Drawing: Users can draw their signature on a canvas.
    Signature Typing: Users can type their name, which is then rendered in a handwriting-style font on the canvas.
    Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
    Save as Image: Users can save their signature as an image.
